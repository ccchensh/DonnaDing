Ussy, 29, was born in Punjab, a Pakistani state bordering India. When he was in the college in 2009, he was involved in sexual activity with his friend of the same sex. His parents found out and the situation became terrible.

          <p>Ussy escaped home after the brutal punishment. He went to another city and then came to the UK with his the help of his friends one year later. After a short period of study near London, Ussy settled down in Nelson eventually. It is small down in Lancashire, north England, which has a Muslim community.</p>
          <p>Ussy has made some friends there, who have given him massive support after hearing his experience in Pakistan. One of his friends told his uncle Ussy’s story and his uncle let Ussy move into his house generously without any rent, which made Ussy very grateful. </p>
          <p>Ussy attands voluntary English classes regularly to improve his English. He also goes to the events organised by UK LGBT community, an attampt to engage with the UK society. </p>
          <p>Even though he has lived in the UK for seven years, Ussy still has not been granted asylum and must report to the police every two weeks, which limits his activities greatly. </p>
          <p>“I am not allowed to work, not doing anything at the moment. I am just thinking about the past all the day, which is not good for my health. I am feeling like I am losing weight, my brain is very heavy all the time. There are too many things.” </p>
          <p>In 2014, Ussy received a letter from his friend in Pakistan, telling him that his parents published a message on the newspaper that they had cut off relationship with him and they were not responsible of him in the future. Ussy said he still missed his family, as well as his country, but being publicly ostracised hurt him deeply.</p>

          <p>“My doctor said I had depression with anxiety. I could only sleep for four to five hours a night. And in that period, I woke up many times every night. I couldn’t have any continuity in my sleep. I can’t. The doctor increased my medication, before it was 20mg template, now it has increased to 30mg. First they start from 10, then to 20, then to 30."</p>
          <p>Not having a job also means he does not have financial resources. Ussy was prosecuted for not paying the council tax, which was beyond his ability to pay. The magistrates’ court ruled him to pay ten pounds a month. At the moment, it is still “very hard” for him.</p>

           <p class="subtitle">Homophobia in Muslims</p>
         <p>Only one year after the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage, Omar Mateen, a 30-year-old Muslim man, killed 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, causing America's deadliest mass shooting ever.</p>
         <p>Back to 2014, a 28-year-old father-of-two killed three gay men he met online. When asking about the motive of the brutal murders, he said the gays were “spreading evil in society” and he had to warn them to “stay away from the evil”.</p>

          <p>The homophobia among Muslims has been a serious problem. According to the <span>2013 Pew Global Study of Homosexuality</span> it showed Muslim countries remain among the least accepting of homosexuality. On average, only one-in-ten people in Muslim countries say homosexuality is acceptable.   </p>

        <p>In Muslim-majority countries, the relationship between the law, religion and the community is complicated. A wide accepted understanding is the religion, seen as the very basis of human life, dictates the culture, and then the community. The religion also plays a vital role of maintaining law and order of the Muslim societies.</p>
         <h3 class="smalltitle">Qur’an</h3>
         <p>Muslims condemnations of homosexuality are mainly based on the the teachings of the Qur’an and Sunnah. In Islamic terminology, homosexuality is alternatively called ‘al-fahsha’ (an obscene act), shudhudh (abnormality), or ‘amal qawm Lut (behavior of the People of Lut).</p>
         <p>In the <span>Qur’an</span>, Sodom and Gomorrah were two cities destroyed by God due to the immense immorality. Islamic groups continue to used the concept of ‘Sodom’ and ‘Gomorrah’ as metaphors for homosexuality viewed as a deviation.</p>
         <p>Islam teaches its believers that they should neither participate nor support homosexuality:</p>
      <div class="points">
         <p>It clashes with the "natural" order in which God created human beings</p>
         <p>It brings destruction of the family and the institutions of marriage</p>
         <p>It leads people to ignore God's guidance in other areas of life</p>
       </div>
         <p>Also, the Qur’an describes the pairing of male and female as part of human nature and social order, and the institution of marriage is an foundation of Muslim society, which also meets a person's emotional, psychological, and physical needs.</p>
         <p>However, the explanation of Qur’an and Sunnah varies with some progressive Muslims who think the common punishment of homosexuals has no basis on Qur’an and Sunnah.</p>
         <p>Dr. Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle, a scholar of Muslim culture told the Muslim for Progressive Values that the Qur’an gives rules for relationships between men and women, but it doesn’t set rules for same-sex (gay or lesbian) relationships. That doesn’t mean it forbids relationships between people of the same sex.</p>
         <p>He believes the early Muslim jurists just didn’t accept the situation that a child was born without the support of a father could bring. Also, similar to any other society, Islamic jurists talked a lot about straight relationships as they were trying to address the needs of most people. It doesn’t mean the other sexual identities don’t exist.</p>
         <h3 class="smalltitle">Legal sanction -- Sharia Law</h3>
         <p>Derived from the <span>Qu’ran</span>, Sharia Law is one of the most important legal basis of which homosexuals are prosecuted in most Muslim-majority countries, which has a catastrophic effect on the lives of people who are unlucky enough to be caught.</p>

         <h3 class="smalltitle">Sentenced to death</h3>
         <p>According to Washington Post and International Lesbian and Gay Association, there are 10 Muslim-majority countries that still impose death punishment to people engaged in homosexual activities, some of which the sentencing derives from an interpretation of Sharia Law, which is based on the religious perceptions of Islam, particularly the Qu’ran. In the other Muslim-majority countries, there might not be specific law giving the death penalty to homosexuals but leaders of conservative tribes or religious groups may either summarily execute or sentence homosexuals to death.</p>
         <h3 class="smalltitle">Imprisonment</h3>
         <p>Among these countries, homosexuality is illegal and the punishment is imprisonment normally, for up to 10 years mostly.  In some other Muslim-majority countries, there is no specific law punishing homosexuals but they can be prosecuted by other law. For example, an old law against ‘debauchery’ is often used in Egypt.</p>
         <h3 class="smalltitle">The cultural non-existence</h3>
         <p>Ussy told me his parents didn’t believe he was a gay. It was common in the Muslim-majority world. The public, as well as the officials, consider homosexuality to be a Western phenomenon, not related to Muslims. In some Muslim-majority countries, the number of prosecutions is lower comparatively due to the official fiction that homosexuals is a western phenomenon. The larger number of prosecutions would call that into question.</p>
         <p>In 2007, the then president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, denied the existence of gay people in his country.</p>
         <blockquote>“In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country ... In Iran we do not have this phenomenon.”</blockquote>
         <p>In addition, the pressure to marry in Muslim-majority countries is much greater than the Western World. Remaining single is usually a shame in the community. In most traditional families, young people have to get into the marriage that their parents arranged once completing their studies.</p>
         <p>Some identifying themselves as homosexual give into the pressure from the family and community, accepting the forced marriage, which is ill-suited. Some, like Ussy, attempted to escape from the home, or the country, to a more inclusive area.</p>
         <p>In some cases, coming out would result in the person being ostracised by his/her family or community, even kicked out from the clan officially. If going back, punishment tends to be more physically serious.  </p>
         <h3 class="smalltitle">A culture of impunity</h3>
         <p>Following the interview with a group of muslims with a variety of nationalities, there is a common phenomenon that the anti-gay vigilante attacks tend to be connived by the police and the authority in Muslim-majority countries, which means attackers can always escape from the legal punishment.</p>
         <p>Conservative public may give inhuman treatment to the ‘alleged’ homosexual people in the public area, including lashing, torture, stoning, or abuse. The last step tends to be killing, either summarily executed or by sentencing homosexuals to death.</p>
         <p>More seriously, the culture of impunity would have ‘chilling effect’, ‘encouraging’ more people to get engaged into the brutal punishment to the homosexuals with a reason of ‘morality’. </p>

          <p class="smalltitle">"We haven't stepped forward too much..."</p>
          <p>Khakan Qureshi is a British Muslim LGBT, who has been working for LGBT rights for long time. In 2014, he set up a social support group in Birmingham for Asian LGBTs, which is called ‘Fighting a Voice’. </p>
          <p>When he was trying to set up his own group, he attended some LGBT events organised by the mainstream white people. After sharing his plan to launch an Asian LGBT group, he was always being questioned about the necessity of the decision.</p>
          <p>“It didn’t make sense to me. You shouldn’t ask why I need to set up this LGBT Asian Group. You should say ‘Well done! Let’s support you for this!’”</p>
          <p>Qureshi thought people in the mainstream society lacked the awareness of the struggling life of LGBT communities in other corners of the World. </p>
          <p>Some activists from the Peter Tatchell Foundation, another group promoting for human rights, launched a campaign to address the issue of homophobia and Islamophobia. Sadly, only a very small group of people attended the demonstration.</p>
          <p>‘Stonewall’, one of the largest UK LGBT groups, started to look at the British Muslim LGBT communities recently, nearly three decades after it was set up. </p>
          <p>“It’s only now they decided that their voice needs to be heard! We are a big behind the times. We need some historical movements!”</p>
          <p>With the lack of international support of the Muslim LGBT community, Qureshi appeals for more country leaders toput the human rights abuses issues into their agenda when visiting Muslim-majority countries.</p>
          <p>“If a leader can arrange time for business, he/she should take time to talk about human rights in Muslim countries.”</p>
          <p>As Qureshi observed, most Muslim homophobia issues were spread from social media to a larger scale. He was wondering if it was possible to gather those people who originally posted the news or videos, and let them talk about what they have seen or heard on the mainstream media.  </p>
          <p>He is glad to see the rights of LGBT community has been taken seriously in some Muslim societies.</p>

          </figure>

          <p class="smalltitle">Movement to repeal Section 377</p>
          <p>Section 377 of Indian Penal Code, introduced during the British colonisation of India in 1860s, criminalised sexual activities ‘against the order of nature’, with ‘whoever voluntarily has carnal inter­course against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with impris­onment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine’. Though Section 377 is a law only enforced in India, it has wide influence in the conservative bordering areas, such as Pakistan.</p>
          <p>The controversies and criticisms has been raised since 1990s. Officials argued Section 377 should be retained for avoiding ‘a big health hazard’, and that AIDS and HIV would spread and harm people, whereas the progressive group stated the law only ended up giving an opportunity to law enforcement agencies to harass the LGBT community, with nothing else taking place. </p>
          <p>The Naz Foundation, an activist group, started the legal battle against Section 377 since 1990s. They led a public interest litigation, seeking legalisation of homosexual intercourse between consenting adults. In 2009, Section 377 was struck down by the Delhi High Court in the Naz Foundation Case, with ‘the essence of the section goes against the fundamental right of human citizens’, stated by the high court.</p>
          <p>Though the Indian Supreme Court overturned the decision of the Delhi High Court in an appeal in 2013, ruling that it is the only law criminalising pedophilia, sexual abuse and assault, calls for the scrapping Section 377 are getting louder and louder, including eminent lawyers, jurists, political activists, teachers and students etc.</p>
          <p>Most Indian people believe the wider acceptance of homosexuality around the world and in Indian society, it is only a matter of time before the Parliament and Supreme Court get rid of the Judeo-Christian morality imposed on the Indian public by Section 377. They are looking forward to the day that the LGBTs can live publicly with dignity in India.  </p>

          <section class="final">
          <h4>Final words</h4>
          <p>I often see Ussy sharing LGBT news on social media, sometimes positive news like how justice was served to men who murdered trans people. Sometimes I see negative news like ‘Gay couple caught having sex face being caned 80 times under Sharia law’. I can only imagine how Ussy would feel hopeful sometimes, and disappointed by another attack aimed at homosexual people.  </p>
          <p>As society progresses people are becoming more aware, but we need to take the action.</p>
          <p>Indian people’s appeal to repealing Section 377 is a historical movement to all Muslim LGBT communities. More and more Muslims, like Ussy and Qureshi, are standing out as ‘pioneers’ in the  fight for LGBT rights. We have reasons to believe that Ussy’s dream that “no one should be punished because of their sexualities” can one day become a reality.</p>
